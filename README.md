# Jefferson-Key-Club-Website
Through this website, I designed and coded it for a school club called Jefferson Key Club which is part of the organization, Key Club International.
On this website, members can access upcoming events, and see highlights of past events on a timeline format. 
In addition to that, they can identify the officers of the club and contact any of them.
Lastly, google forms was embedded into the website to allow for easy access for members to RSVP for events as well as a way for us to take attendance. 
I thoroughly enjoyed creating this project and in fact, this was my first website deployed and coded from scratch.
